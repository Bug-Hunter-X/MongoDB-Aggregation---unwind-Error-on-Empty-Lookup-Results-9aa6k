```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "collectionB",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "foreignKey",
      as: "results"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$results" //Error prone if collectionB might not have a match for collectionA
  }
];

// This aggregation pipeline performs a lookup from collectionA to collectionB. However, the $unwind operator can cause an error if there is no match found in collectionB for a document in collectionA.  This could happen if collectionB is empty or doesn't have an entry with a matching foreignKey.

//This will result in an error like this:
//"error": "The field 'results' is missing in the object" 
```
